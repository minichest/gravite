## 0. Introduction

### We'll just start with a small interpolation.

> Pendu is Penaldo. Penaldo is Pendu. There has been multiple adaptions of this idea of Penduism - associated with Penaldo statpadding against small teams and consistently only scoring penalties in most games. Adaptions of this idea of Penduism includes Penaldo - Penalty Shootout which can be installed [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.Penaldo) or via [apkpure](https://apkpure.com/penaldo-penalty-shoot-out/air.Penaldo) Let's get to the main focus now...here below are a list of the top Pendu Pics that I have seen.

### Some More Info On Pendus. Pendu is a word in the English Dictionary for the 'culturally backward', but most importantly Pendu is a fraud from portugal who only scores tap in and penalties - he like to steal pens a lot to keep his deluded fans happy.

### Now We Can Start with our list of Pendus.

---------------------------------------
## 5. International Statpadding Pendu.

### What more is there to say. He eats, sleep and statpads pens for a living. It is not very much a wonder that when he is playing against credible teams that he generally ghosts. [Get Up Pendulum](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article22105429.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1351657675.jpg), ur back ain't hurt like that. We get it Pendu, you cannot score for shit in front of Manchester City now so enjoy your mediocre retirement. We get it Pendu, Kevin De Bruyne is worlds ahead of you in terms of the best footballer in Manchester - this ain't no dream homecoming for you or your pens. This a nightmarish homecoming for you and your nonexistant pens.

---------------------------------------
## 4. The Ghostcoming

### We talked about homecomings. Now, we on GhostComings. If you cannot read this for shit, I would say go to Specsavers...scratch that Go To Specsavers right now and get a job. It states the 'Incredible Story Of Ghostnaldo' - very much a quintessential and thrilling story in how such a glorified pen merchant has been reduced to dust in England. There is no Crotones in the EPL - Pendu, we only got scones and Stones in this country. His team is already out of every competition, got himself stuck in Dias's pocket - even got outshone at his own home stadium by Bernardo Silva. It says it all when you are the 4th best Portuguese Player in your city - he in that Phantom mode.

---------------------------------------
## 3. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it is Reinildo's pocket.

### Lodi Hell. That's uer Lodi. Red and Buried. Pendu - be red and pocketed. Reinildo could probably have pocketed him for 24 hours let alone a hour and a half. Reinildo pocketed Pendu's ass so bad - i heard his name like it Brazillian Football. He went from [showing off his cajones](https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/03/GettyImages-1130139055.jpg) to [ghosting against the same opposition in a couple years.](https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4829694.1647531014!/image/image.jpg) - that be what happens to you when your pen time continuum is on its last leg. No Pens, No Party except those Phantom Parties.

---------------------------------------
## 2. The Pendu Slip

![Pendu Slip](https://www.theconclaveng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220205-WA0024.jpg)

### People be talking about the Gerrard Slip. Obviously, I was laughing at the Gerrard Slip...I mean my team ended up winning the league due to it. Thanks Steven! This isn't the point though. The main point is the Pendu Slip or Slip Up is not as held in much infamy as the Gerrard Slip - and it should. I thought Pendu was at least capable of statpadding with pens. It seems that his guts turned into ice when he saw himself eye to eye with Joe Lumley. This Pendu is more finished than the other versions of Pendu, whether or not he summons random hattricks for Manchester's Number 2 and an Europa League level team's victory.

## 1. Ghost Of Manchester

### It states all we need to know, all we know that's the truth. It's been said that the truth is key. Key in unlocking the Myth. Myth as in the Fraudery of Pendu. Pendu, we know who that fraud is and with that see you later for Round 3. Shoutout to [TheFatherDias](https://twitter.com/TheFatherDias), [his tweet](https://twitter.com/TheFatherDias/status/1503858100356460548) made me want to write this entire post.
