# Spurs vs Man City (2021-22 EPL, Matchday 1)

### My thoughts on us next season, hopefully we have some sort of success. It is always good to start off the season on the right track; this team is a mix of players that are in form and have not played for some time - so should have rest and hopefully matchfit for our game against Spurs. Last Year was pretty incredible, we reached our first ever Champions League Final and won yet another Premier League title. Dias was a phenomenal signing and completely reformed our defence from the chaos of 19-20 and Ferran excelled in the limited gametime he recieved. Anyways, let me tell you the team that should play the first game against Spurs. 

## <u>Goalkeeper: Ederson</u>

### He is our Number 1 as of now, even thought the likes of Steffen and Carson have had a preseason - Ederson's qualities and significance in how we play assures him of a spot against Spurs. Ederson has shown over the years that he is one of the best gks at passing of the ball if not the best but people don't remember how good he is at shot-stopping. There is a reason after all that he has won 2 Golden Gloves and almost got 3 but Alisson edged him by 1.

## <u>Left Back: Benjamin Mendy</u>

### Zinchenko needs somewhat of a rest and Mendy has been waiting in the stands. While Zinchenko did have 1 brilliant peformance in the euros, it seems like the Champions League Final error had gotten to him. We all know that Mendy is error-prone but he didn't cause too many mistakes at all last season and seemed pretty good. Also, he would have had a full pre-season unlike Zinchenko so I would expect him to start.

## <u>Centre Back: Ruben Dias</u>

### The commander and leader of this backline, the wall of this defence and the impenetrable force that led us to storm the EPL and reach our first ever Champions League Final. Brilliant signing and should start for us even though he had a shaky euros with Portugal - getting defeated by Belgium in the first round of the Knockouts. He has shown that he is able to control and lead the defence like Kompany did all those years ago; He is a must for this match even if he had a poor Euros.

## <u>>Centre Back: John Stones</u>

### We might as well continue the formidable relationship in our defence that catapulted us to glory, Stones had a fantastic euros with England albeit losing the final to Italy. While it was disappointing for him, Stones would surely have recovered from the disappointment in order to start off where they left off from the previous year. He and Stones have a task ahead of them to mark Son or Kane but they most likely would triumph in their efforts if deployed in the right way.

## <u>Right Back: Walker</u>

### We all know that a Benjamin Mendy and Joao Cancelo combination on the flanks doesn't work. Also, Joao Cancelo just had Covid so it is a risk to put him back into the fray too early. Furthermore, there is no need to do that kind of risk when you have an inform Kyle Walker. Just like Stones, Walker had a brilliant euros as England were mere moments away from victory at the Euros. His speed, strength and defensive capabilities make him a must in our backline against Spurs offensive verve.

## <u>Central Defensive Midfielder: Fernandinho</u>

### Fernandinho seems to be fine, he didn't play any matches during the Euros and Copa America season. We all know what Fernandinho brings to the pitch - that destroyer mentality and the key cog in City's armour over the past 4-5 years. Without him, City would seem like a shell of what we can be as the midfield was often unbalanced. However, he is not the same destroyer as he was a couple years ago as he has naturally got slower since then - but can still do a job in that position.

## <u>Left Central Midfielder: Foden</u>

### We only played him in this position once and he had a pretty decent game - got a goal and could play a David Silva role in the team for this match. I don't need to talk about the qualities of Phil Foden; he missed a large chunk of the Euros so he should be fit and primed for the match against Tottenham.

## <u>Right Central Midfielder: Mr Whippy</u>

### Great Season, Last Year. He might not be playing the exact same role as he did last season but he should have still have a seismic impact on where the game is won and last. He hasn't let the club done very often and who knows he might get a goal out of nowhere.

## <u>Right Winger: Sterling</u>

### Sterling has scored a lot of goals on the left. His best season of 31 goals was on the left - however he plays better on the right despite scoring less goals and showed why he is good on either flank at the Euros; he almost got England to Euros glory despite a dropoff in form with us in 19-20. He should cause a nightmare for the Spurs Players marking him. He is gonna have a good season and this is going to be his redemption season after a hit-and-miss, rocky season before.

## <u>Striker / False 9: De Bruyne</u>

### It is Kevin De Bruyne, he is one of those players you have to start. He is not the best finisher in the world but is a good playmaker and often shows up in the biggest games for clubs. He was sensational last year with wonder goals against PSG and Borussia Monchengladbach to add to his collection. Also, he could drop back slightly and turn our formation into a 4-1-2-1-2, take the spot of Foden as the English youngster drives forward or go wide and allow Sterling to play striker with Jesus (4-4-2).

## <u>Left Winger: Gabriel Jesus</u>

### He has shown that he plays his best stuff as a psuedo winger / second striker, just ask any Brazil Fan. He doesn't have the finishing ability of a top striker just yet but he has played pretty well whenever he has had a strike partner - from the likes of Neymar to Aguero. He knows that this is realistically his last chance to prove he is good enough for the club so he has to start this match. Also, his pressing ability and workrate is unmatched in the team except for Bernardo Silva so he is a necessary asset to our attack.

## <u>Expectations this season:</u>

### Another league title would be nice but this has to be the season we lift the Champions League - there should be no fear or Guardiola knockouts experiments so we will be fine.
