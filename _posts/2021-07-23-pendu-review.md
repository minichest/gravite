## Pendu is Penaldo. Penaldo is Pendu. 
### There has been multiple adaptions of this idea of Penduism - associated with Penaldo statpadding against small teams and consistently only scoring penalties in most games. Adaptions of this idea of Penduism includes Penaldo - Penalty Shootout which can be installed [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.Penaldo) or via [apkpure](https://apkpure.com/penaldo-penalty-shoot-out/air.Penaldo) Let's get to the main focus now...here below are a list of the top Pendu Pics that I have seen. Anyways, let us start with our list:

## 5. Who needs a call of duty?

### What could possibly be better than call of duty? Oh yes, the world famous call of pendu as seen below. Instead of having soldiers, you can have teams like cagliari and torino with the main character of course being penaldo. It seems to have been pretty successful with the biggest pen merchant of the year award and feel free to get a Pen Station 5 to enjoy the Best Of Pendu.

## 4. Give him it, feed him it

### He needs 1 desperately, what are you waiting for? Also, watch out for his gun...just give him any penalty. Slabhead, Fridge, Harry Maguire, you had a penalty in Greece - why did you not give it to Pendu? He would have very much enjoyed that gift of a beloved penalty to store in his collection and whole package of penalties dating from his early career in the 2000s. I mean, humanity is at risk of succumbing to the acts of pendu if we don't give him it to him right now. Anyone, whoever is going to referee the next Ronaldo Game - give him a penalty for the sake of humanity. ![save](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/705365548120277103/866389008548757515/20210609_120906.jpg)

## 3. Penalty-Man The Movie

### We all love a good movie or series right. Most people like the Fast And Furious franchise starred by the Rock (Dwayne Johnson) - the most successful movie star in the world; some just enjoy watching other movies like Guardians Of The Galaxy featuring Drax (Dave Bautista). However, none of their moves will ever top - let alone even come close to the masterclass of a production that we all know as Penalty-Man; a story of a pen merchant using his pen taking abilities to save the world.

## 2. Super Pendu To The Rescue!

### Pendu is pretty much super man against other teams. People often see that Ronaldo's best performances in Serie A are saved for the smaller teams. For Example, he generally ghosted in his games against some of the best teams in Italy but found the time to score a brace against Crotone as well as 2 goals against Parma. Also, he got his finisher's guile against poor Cagliari dropping 5 goals on their defence. Weirdly Enough, he ghosted against Benevento - the only team he failed to score against in Serie A's bottom 5 which could be due to him knowing about this article.

## 1. The Amazing Luxembourg Man

### It didn't end too well at a certain part but the purpose of this meme is clear. Pendu tends to statpad goals against small teams very often in his road to success. Across his international career, Penaldo has scored 71% of his international tally against teams outside the top 50 and 32 of his 109 goals (32%) against teams outside the top 100 in the world rankings. He has scored 7 goals against Lithuania as well as 5 goals against the likes of Andorra, Armenia, Latvia, Luxembourg and Sweden. Not far behind, you have his mighty 4 goals against Estonia, Faroe Islands, Hungary and the Netherlands. Then, he has dropped 3 goals on the defence of Belgium, Denmark, Northern Ireland, Russia, Spain and Switzerland. Furthermore, he still found time to net 2 to the despair of Azerbaijan, Bosnia, Cameroon, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Egypt, Kazakhstan and Saudi Arabia. Finally, only a measly 1 goal against Argentina, Croatia, Ecuador, Finland, Ghana, Greece, Iceland, Iran, Morocco, New Zealand, North Korea, Panama, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Ukraine, Wales (as of 2019).
